genshin impact/honkai star rail/zenless zone zero build planner, making this for
my final project for my cmpm 169 class

okay so my final project is a genshin/honkai star rail/zenless zone zero build
calculator/planner it starts out with the main page titled character build
planner. the main page is titles Character Build Planner and has 4 buttons -
home, data, inventory, calender data opens up the import data from json, export
data from json , clear data from planner. inventory is select a game to see what
materials it has in stock. calender is all the events in all the games and some
other stuff clicking the + sign opens a pop up asking to chose a game, and then
either a character from the game or a custom character (which if chosen opens
another pop up asking for what the character uses to level up and then it lwill
open another pop up for the goal). choosing a character from the game will just
go directly to the goal pop up. the goals pop up will ask for the goal for the
character and what weapon they will use (it is different for each game - max
level for genshin is 90 and there are only 3 talents to level, max level for hsr
is 80 and there 4 talents + branch nodes to level up, max level for zzz is 60
and there are 5 talents to level up) clicking on a character thats been added to
the planner opens up character details list - which will have the characters
current stats, the goal stats, a materials list, and a timetable of how long it
will take to get everything. there is also a start farming button that will put
this build on the calender and use the timetable to estimate when the enddate is
main page bottom left corner is inventory - this will affect the timetable (if
it is in inventory then there are less things needed to farm) main page bottom
right corner is calender (will include any characters that have builds in
progress and the events for each game on it)
