genshin impact/honkai star rail/zenless zone zero build planner, making this for
my final project for my cmpm 169 class

okay so my final project is a genshin/honkai star rail/zenless zone zero build
calculator/planner

data page - import data, export data, clear data inventory page - inventory of
all items calender page - tbd, was supposed to be a way to track how long
building a character would take, would also have each game's in game events all
in one place character page - add a character from a game (right now its just
genshin with the correct details), set a goal for them, click on their pic to
see the progress towards the goal, and then go to calculate artifs to try and
generate artifacts and stuff

postmortem: everything went alright. making a custom character was harder than i
orginally anticipated (still need to figure out how to do that). downloading all
the pngs also took way long than i was expecting bc i didnt realize just how
much items the game had.

artistic statement: I wanted to make this because I play all three games
(Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero) a lot, and I have a
lot of Discord friends who also play those a lot. The gear calculator is
something I liked mathing out for my friends who were struggling with character
builds. There were a lot of different sites like the one I made with this
(character build planner, character build rater, etc) but each on only focused
on one game, and none of them did the thing I liked doing, so I decided to make
this the focus of my final project.

Credits: all webp files and png files were downloaded from
genshin-impact.fandom.com, all of the data related to the game were sourced from
genshin-impact.fandom.com, used a combination of deepseek ai and copilot in vs
code to iron out the creases and help bug fix stuff ( had an issue earlier where
the pngs were showing up correctly on a live server but not on the published
site, so consulted copilot on how to fix that ). also was using deepseek help
with the structure of the files in my data folder.

PSA: Like I said during the video, this was originally going to be a
calculator/plannor for all three games, but I did not realize just how many
assets there were going to be for each game. I ended up downloading a majority
of the assets needed for ascension materials, as well as all the assets for
characters, and the gear, but I got part way through weapons and just kind of
gave up because the list of stuff I needed to import was just getting
astronomical. I do plan on adding more to this in the future because I want to
make this work for me and my friends, so the stuff that I dont finish now will
definitely be done in the future.
